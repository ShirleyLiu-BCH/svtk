    """
    Report if the samples called in two VCF records overlap sufficiently.

    The fraction of each record's samples which are shared with the other
    record is calculated. The record with a greater fraction of shared samples
    must exceed the upper threshold AND the record with a lesser fraction of
    shared samples must exceed the lower threshold. This is intended to
    maximize sensitivity in rare variants with a false negative in one
    breakpoint.
