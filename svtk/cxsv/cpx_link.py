def samples_overlap(recA, recB, upper_thresh=0.5, lower_thresh=0.5):
    """
    Report if the samples called in two VCF records overlap sufficiently.

    The fraction of each record's samples which are shared with the other
    record is calculated. The record with a greater fraction of shared samples
    must exceed the upper threshold AND the record with a lesser fraction of
    shared samples must exceed the lower threshold. This is intended to
    maximize sensitivity in rare variants with a false negative in one
    breakpoint.

    Parameters
    ----------
    recA : pysam.VariantRecord
    recB : pysam.VariantRecord
    upper_thresh : float, optional
        Minimum sample overlap in record with greater overlap
    lower_thresh : float, optional
        Minimum sample overlap in record with lesser overlap

    Returns
    -------
    samples_overlap : bool
        Samples shared between records meet required thresholds.
